The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we interact with people, things, and the world around us. Social distance enablement is one and only effective method to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. The whole developers in the world are trying to create software or hardware related products to wipe out the spreading of disease.

Here we are dealing with the Physical queues. So physical queues are one of the major threats for the social distancing act. Being in a physical queue there are huge chances of spreading the disease. In a certain queue, we need to receive physical tokens from the counter that will also increase the chances of getting the disease. Peoples hate nothing more than standing in queues, uncertain when their turn will come to receive their service. Long queues will probably result in tangles. So maintaining a physical queue is actually a big risk for the service provider(The authority who provides services) and also for the peoples who need to be in the queue.

The virtual queue and tokens are an effective way to handle the queue these days. But most of the virtual queue needs a dedicated complex software and the internet connection. Poor internet connection will probably bring you to the last in a queue. For handling the complex software the person needs little skills.

So here we are introducing the Queue Management Node(QMN) which is a simple user-friendly smart queue maker powered by Arduino MKR WiFI 1010.
